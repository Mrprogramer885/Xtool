changelog to 1.2.1 Stable version:

This version is a not big update, mainly fixing and improving Xtool. But i also dded few more functions. More below!

It has took me some time to get this next update done, i had new version, with about 3-4x times more features on my PC disk which failed and i lost it.
It has been some time to reimplement atleast 30-40% of those lost features. But i managed to do it, and now 1.2.1 version is here.
Thank you for staying with Xtool for so long and not losing interest. I wish it may help you with anything it can help.
Sincerely:
theczechceo - Owner, Main developer.
