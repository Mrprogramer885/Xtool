Xtool help:

First Notice:
Xtool requires valid internet connection and 100mb of storage for its packages. If you dont have stable internet connection. 
Use mobile data. I have managed to optimize Xtool so even high usage should not consume more than 1-3mb of data.

Also Xtool cannot work with VPNs due to all the IPs provided by VPN being blacklisted. If you still wanna use VPNs with Xtool,
be ready for big amounts of errors or ratelimits.

WARNING: USING XTOOL TOO MUCH CAN RESULT IN BEING RATELIMITED. THIS IS MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH INSTALOADER IF USED 3X+ TIMES IN ROW.
MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THIS TOOL WITH LITTLE BREAKS.

(1: IP search) This can search big amount of info on IP address. 
Select option and input valid IP address, the info should appear within 5 seconds

(2: Phone lookup) This extracts phone number info using phone lookup database. it extracts info like carries,
country code, if the number is valid and etc.

the links to the websites where the username is located will be printed.

(10: check for update) This will check if new version of Xtool is available, for now, (i could not include automatic update, so in order to update, you need to reinstall entire Xtool from github).

Additional CLI commands:
